Greetings! I’m Le Nguyen Phuc Loc, a Junior DevOps Engineer with a proven track record at ATOM Solution, where I drove impactful projects in Payment Systems and Cloud Computing from June 2024 to April 2025.

During my tenure, I contributed to critical production initiatives, including Atom Processor x BVBank, Merchant Platform x OCB, ViTrust, and WESAP. These experiences deepened my expertise in Payment ecosystems, encompassing Core Card, Core Banking, and secure infrastructure aligned with PCI-DSS standards.

A standout achievement was spearheading a cloud optimization campaign, slashing infrastructure costs by 40% while upholding performance and reliability. I also designed and implemented CI/CD pipelines, orchestrating scalable microservices on Kubernetes for Payment, ERP, and Web3 systems, significantly boosting development agility and efficiency.

Proficient in tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and Terraform, and skilled in containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, I played a key role in migrating environments from AWS to CMC and FPT Cloud, enhancing scalability and performance.

I ensured robust system availability for critical technologies—PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Kafka, EMQX, and Minio—through replica and cluster setups, bolstering fault tolerance. Additionally, I automated monitoring and logging with Grafana Stack and Elastic Stack, elevating system performance visibility.

Beyond technical expertise, I bring strong communication and collaborative skills, coupled with a passion for creative problem-solving to tackle complex challenges.

I’m excited about the prospect of contributing my skills to innovative projects and team success—let’s connect to explore the possibilities!
